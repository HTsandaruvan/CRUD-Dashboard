# CRUD-Dashboard

## The Java CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Application is a robust software solution developed to efficiently manage and manipulate data. Built using core Java, the application features a user-friendly interface that enables users to perform essential database operations such as adding new records, viewing existing data, updating details, and deleting entries. It leverages a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for secure and reliable data storage and retrieval, ensuring data integrity.

Key features of the application include input validation, error handling, and seamless data interaction, making it an ideal tool for small to medium-sized businesses or personal data management. This project showcases my skills in Java programming, database integration, and application development, demonstrating a practical understanding of the full-stack development lifecycle.
